# Functionality Yet to be Implemented.

Social media login (either Facebook or Google). Maybe

Pictures in the list.

Refine button should change what it says based on the spinners selected.

More tests.

# Known Bugs.

If the user attempts to access one of their lists but the list is empty, it shows nothing.

If the user deletes the app data, their information will not match with the info on server.

User can smash any of the rank buttons for a chosen gun and make that gun whatever rank they want.
