# Functionality Yet to be Implemented.
Clicking on the bug report with need to either that the user to their mail app, or we will create 
an email and send it ourselves in the code.

Social media login (either Facebook or Google).

Buttons on the weapon details page need to create or delete the correct entry in the corresponding
 table in the database.
 
Those buttons also need to be switched to icons.

Incorporate pictures in the list and/or detailed weapon pages.

More tests.

Tweak the refinement of the lists so that the user can use any combination of the three spinners.
