# DestinyGuns
A mobile application for android devices that is used to access a database of Destiny exotic and 
legendary weapons. This is a projct started for a few courses at the University of Washington 
Tacoma with Robert Gillis.

# Functionality Yet to be Implemented.

Social media login (either Facebook or Google). Maybe

Incorporate pictures in the list and/or detailed weapon pages.
    Got icons for either on the detail page or both that and the list.

More tests.

# Known Bugs.

If the user attempts to access one of their lists but the list is empty, it shows nothing.

If the user deletes the app data, their information will not match with the info on server.

User can smash any of the rank buttons for a chosen gun and make that gun whatever rank they want.
